# ES6-lab-solutions
 Full ES6 practice solutions from Day 1 lab, including destructuring, spread/rest usage, array methods, arrow functions, class-based inheritance, abstract modules, and shape calculations with area and perimeter.

This repository contains full solutions to the **Day 1 ES6 lab** exercises, starting from basic syntax practices to advanced class-based abstraction with modules.

Contents

Basic ES6 Exercises
- Swapping variables using destructuring
- Using spread/rest parameters to get min and max
- Array methods: `map`, `filter`, `forEach`, `every`, `some`
- Arrow functions and conditionals
- Capitalizing strings, filtering arrays, checking case

Advanced Task â€“ Shape Classes
- Abstract `Shape` base class with `area()`, `perimeter()` and `display()`
- Subclasses: `Rectangle`, `Square`, `Circle`
- Uses `ES6 Modules` for code separation and import/export
- Dynamic calculation of area and perimeter
- Console-based output via a `display()` method
